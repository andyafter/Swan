# Swan
Swan is simply used to test whether I really cannot beat the artificial intelligence made by University of Alberta which is actually published at the beginning of year 2015. 
They claim to have built an artificial intelligence that can beat any human in the game of limit heads-up holdem. So I wrote a simple program that I can play with it but there is several bugs inside this program that I really don't bother to fix. 

Anyway if you really want to know what the most useful thing inside this program, check out the query method, that part is the most valuable thing because I have to do a lot of research for that one single query.

I will make Swan cool again after I finish all of the hackathon this month.
